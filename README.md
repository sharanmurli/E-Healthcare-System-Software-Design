## Overview

The E-Healthcare System is designed to provide users with an online platform for consulting doctors and obtaining medical prescriptions. It aims to offer rapid, direct, and documented communication pathways for consultation, providing urgent help and allowing users to interact with doctors via message or video chat.

## Features

- 24/7 doctor availability for consultation.
- Online chat and video chat with doctors.
- E-prescriptions sent directly to users via email.
- Medicine delivery with discounts.
- User feedback system for continuous improvement.
- Appointment scheduling for consulting specific doctors.

## Diagrams

## Project Structure

- **Admin Interface**: Monitors the system, manages doctors and patients, oversees feedback, and tracks payments.
- **User Interface**: Allows users to register, login, consult doctors, receive e-prescriptions, and order medicines.
- **Doctor Interface**: Enables doctors to update availability, consult patients, and send prescriptions.
